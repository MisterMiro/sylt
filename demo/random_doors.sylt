## demonstrates how to use the Rand.oneIn function to implement probability

Rand.seed(System.timestamp())

let n = 300000
let states = []
rep(fun _ -> states += if Rand.oneIn(20): "open" else "closed" n)

let closed = List.count("closed" states)
let open = List.count("open" states)

printLn("Checking " + n + " doors...")
printLn("Open: " + open)
printLn("Closed: " + closed)
printLn(toString((open / closed) * 100) + "% of the doors are open")
