## demonstrates how to reassign a variable using the '<-' operator,
## and the difference between assignment and binding a new variable
## with the same name

let x = "hello"
let y = "morning"
printLn(x)
printLn(y)

{
    x <- "goodbye"
    let y = "evening"
}

printLn(x) ## "goodbye"
printLn(y) ## still "morning"
